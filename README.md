### About Me

Hey there! I'm Mulaza, a web developer who loves creating web apps and writing Python scripts. My passion lies in automation, and I love exploring new ways to automate everyday tasks. In addition to coding, I am also an avid comic book reader and collector. When I'm not coding or reading comics, you can find me exploring nature trails. Check out my repositories to see some of the projects I've been working on recently. Let's connect and collaborate on something awesome!
